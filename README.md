# Iris Dataset Classification using Gaussian Naive Bayes

## Project Overview

This project applies **Gaussian Naive Bayes** from the **scikit-learn** library to classify species of flowers in the **Iris** dataset. The Iris dataset contains measurements of different flower species, and the goal is to predict the species based on these measurements.

## Key Features

- **Dataset**: 
  - The **Iris dataset** is a classic dataset available in scikit-learn. It contains 150 instances of iris flowers with 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target is the species of the flower, which can be one of three types: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

- **Modeling**:
  - **Gaussian Naive Bayes** is used for classification. This algorithm is based on Bayes' Theorem and assumes that features follow a normal distribution (Gaussian).

- **Evaluation**:
  - The model's accuracy is evaluated, and metrics such as confusion matrix and classification report are used to measure performance.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
